But let me shock you with another fact: Not everyday we see the stars at the same position as before.Scroll through our website to learn more about how dynamic the night sky really is! </p>

      <h3>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</h3>
      <p>You might not know or might have never thought of but the stars are on a constant change. The reason this is not widely known is because this changes might happen to slow or are too small to be seen by us. Another cute thing that gladly we can spot sometimes on the night sky are how stars twinkle. This is a phenomenon that happens because turbulence in Earth’s atmosphere interferes with the starlight as it travels to the planet’s surface. As we said this is something we can easily see without the need with a tool like telescopes, but scientists who have used these tools have found out different ways stars light changes bringing out for us different variations. If you want to check out other amazing things telescopes have found have a look here at Kepler’s Telescope adventure which was launched in 2009.</p>

      <h3>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</h3>
      <p>You might not know or might have never thought of but the stars are on a constant change. The reason this is not widely known is because this changes might happen to slow or are too small to be seen by us. Another cute thing that gladly we can spot sometimes on the night sky are how stars twinkle. This is a phenomenon that happens because turbulence in Earth’s atmosphere interferes with the starlight as it travels to the planet’s surface. As we said this is something we can easily see without the need with a tool like telescopes, but scientists who have used these tools have found out different ways stars light changes bringing out for us different variations. If you want to check out other amazing things telescopes have found have a look here at Kepler’s Telescope adventure which was launched in 2009.</p>
